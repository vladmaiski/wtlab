            <time datetime="2020-02-25">12 February, 2021</time>
            <p>On this week our website was attacked with the aim of stop the development of our service,
                because in this way we motivate meat companies to kill more animals and destroy Earth's ecosystem.
                We learned, that this attacks were organised by the environmental movement leader Greta Thunberg.
                We will try to calm the situation.</p>
